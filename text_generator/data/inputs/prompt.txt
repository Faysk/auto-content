Write a personal and engaging summary of the book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert T. Kiyosaki.

Use the following style:

Write as if you’re telling someone what you personally learned from the book, in a clear, natural, and well-structured way.

Divide the content by chapters or key lessons, using simple and descriptive titles.

In each section, highlight the core ideas and share reflections, comparisons, or examples that help explain what the author meant — especially the contrast between the “Rich Dad” and the “Poor Dad”.

Keep the tone accessible, conversational, and insightful — as if you’re explaining to someone interested in personal finance, but avoid technical jargon or overly academic language.

At the end, include a section titled “What Stayed with Me” with up to 10 practical lessons or powerful takeaways that summarize the essence of the book.

Do not invent content that is not in the book. Stay true to the author’s message, but feel free to include your own interpretation and relatable insights to make the ideas feel human and real.
