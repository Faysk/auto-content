Write a personal and engaging summary of the book "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel.

Use the following style:
- Write as if you’re telling someone what you learned from the book, in a clear, natural, and well-structured way.
- Divide the content by chapters or key themes, using simple and descriptive titles.
- In each section, highlight the central ideas and share examples or reflections that help convey what the author meant.
- Keep the tone accessible, direct, and conversational — as if you're speaking to someone curious about personal finance, but avoid technical jargon.
- At the end, include a section titled “What Stayed with Me” with up to 10 practical lessons or powerful takeaways that capture the core message of the book.

Do not invent content that is not part of the original work. Stay true to the author’s ideas, but feel free to include your own interpretation and insights in a natural way.
