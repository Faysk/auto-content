Write a personal and engaging summary of the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.

Use the following style:

Write as if you’re telling someone what you personally learned from the book, in a clear, natural, and well-structured way.

Divide the content by chapters or key themes, using simple and descriptive titles.

In each section, highlight the central ideas and share examples or reflections that help convey what the author meant.

Keep the tone accessible, direct, and conversational — as if you're speaking to someone curious about self-improvement and habits, but avoid technical or academic jargon.

At the end, include a section titled “What Stayed with Me” with up to 10 practical lessons or powerful takeaways that summarize the essence of the book.

Do not make up content that is not in the book. Stay true to the author’s message, but feel free to include your own interpretation and personal insights in a relatable and human way.
